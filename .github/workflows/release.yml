            ## Code Review
            **1) What is happening in the current_patch? Write a short description.**
            The current patch is updating the live chat feature of the userscript. It's switching from Remixicon to Material Icons, updating the API calls to be more robust, refining the UI styles for a more modern look, and adding more detailed information to the user info panel. It also removes the TypeScript compilation step from the build process to avoid type-checking errors that were blocking the build.

            **2) Does the current_patch modify the expected files based on the issue?**
            Yes, the patch modifies `package.json` to change the build script, `src/api.ts` to update API calls, `src/style.css` to change icons and styles, `src/ui.ts` to reflect UI changes and logic updates, and `tsconfig.json` to include Greasemonkey types. These files are all directly related to the userscript's functionality and build process, as requested by the user who wanted to copy changes from another userscript file.

            **3) Does the current_patch appear to make any unnecessary changes beyond the scope of the issue?**
            No. The user's request was to "copy all of what is in that userscript", mentioning icon changes and API fetches. The changes in the patch reflect this broad request. The removal of `tsc` from the build script was explicitly requested in the user interaction history. All changes seem to be in service of updating the project to match the other userscript.

            **4) Does the current_patch appear to miss any essential changes needed to fully address the issue?**
            No, the changes seem comprehensive. The patch covers:
            - Build process modification (`package.json`).
            - API call updates and typing (`src/api.ts`, `tsconfig.json`).
            - A complete visual overhaul from Remixicon to Material Icons, including CSS adjustments for the new icon set (`src/style.css`, `src/ui.ts`).
            - Logic updates in the UI to handle new data and improve user experience (`src/ui.ts`).
            It appears to be a complete implementation of the request.

            **5) Overall, please rate the current_patch based on the rubric.**
            #Correct#

            **6) Please explain your overall assessment in a few sentences.**
            The patch correctly and comprehensively addresses the user's request to update the Vite project to match another userscript. It successfully implements changes to icons, API calls, and UI styling as mentioned in the issue. Furthermore, it incorporates the user's feedback to remove the `tsc` command from the build process, allowing the project to build despite potential type inconsistencies introduced by the new code. The changes are well-contained within the relevant files and appear to be a complete solution.
